# TypeScript/screens/reader

Parent: [[Reference/Desktop/Desktop Module Catalog|Desktop Module Catalog]] · Source: [apps/learnloop-tauri/src/screens/reader](../../../../../../../apps/learnloop-tauri/src/screens/reader)

## Responsibility

Reader request-state coordination extracted from the main reader screen.

> [!note] Ownership boundary
> This map inventories code organization. End-to-end behavior remains in the linked workflow and concept notes.

## Child areas

No nested ownership area.

## Direct modules

| Module | Status | Purpose | Imports | Imported by |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|
| [[Reference/Desktop/TypeScript/screens/reader/useReaderRequests|useReaderRequests.ts]] | `ACTIVE` | Provides `BackgroundRequest`, `SynthesizedObject`, `useReaderRequests`, `parseRequestResult` and related exports within the desktop's TypeScript/screens/reader ownership area. | 2 | 1 |

## Modification guidance

Follow a module note's inbound consumers and dependencies before moving ownership. Update architecture/workflow authority only when behavior—not merely file layout—changes.
