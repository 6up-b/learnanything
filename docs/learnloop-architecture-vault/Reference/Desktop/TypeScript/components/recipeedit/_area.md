# TypeScript/components/recipeedit

Parent: [[Reference/Desktop/Desktop Module Catalog|Desktop Module Catalog]] · Source: [apps/learnloop-tauri/src/components/recipeedit](../../../../../../../apps/learnloop-tauri/src/components/recipeedit)

## Responsibility

Recipe-tree editing for structured learning plans.

> [!note] Ownership boundary
> This map inventories code organization. End-to-end behavior remains in the linked workflow and concept notes.

## Child areas

No nested ownership area.

## Direct modules

| Module | Status | Purpose | Imports | Imported by |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|
| [[Reference/Desktop/TypeScript/components/recipeedit/RecipeTreeEditor|RecipeTreeEditor.tsx]] | `ACTIVE` | Provides the reusable `RecipeTreeEditor` interaction surface used by one or more desktop workflows. | 3 | 1 |

## Modification guidance

Follow a module note's inbound consumers and dependencies before moving ownership. Update architecture/workflow authority only when behavior—not merely file layout—changes.
