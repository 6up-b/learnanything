# `schema_migrations`

> [!info] Active
> The table participates in a current persistence, audit, projection, or workflow contract.

## Why it exists

Records exactly which numbered SQL migrations have been applied to this database. It preserves the decision trail and is never cleared by derived-state rebuilds. Rows bind `version`, `name`, making the operational relationship explicit. ^table-purpose

It belongs to the **schema and change** navigation family. The family context lives in [[Database Catalog#Schema And Change]]. Its persistence behavior follows [[Table Roles#Receipt]].

## Persistence and lifecycle contract

- **Role:** `receipt` — Historical audit/decision receipt. It is preserved and never rebuilt.
- **Functionality status:** `active`.
- **Introduced by:** `migrations/001_initial.sql`.
- **Schema touched by:** `001_initial.sql`.
- **Rebuild owner:** none; this table is preserved by the rebuild umbrella.

For the distinction between SQLite state and human-authored vault files, see [[State and Persistence]]. For whole-vault creation and opening behavior, see [[Vault Lifecycle]]. ^table-lifecycle

## Columns

| Column | SQLite type | Required | Default | Key | Operational reading |
|---|---|---:|---|---|---|
| `version` | `INTEGER` | no | — | PRIMARY KEY | Stored value |
| `name` | `TEXT` | yes | — | — | Stored value |
| `applied_at` | `TEXT` | yes | — | — | Timestamp (ISO-8601 UTC text) |

## Relationships and access paths

No SQLite foreign key is declared. Identifier-looking columns are application-validated soft references where applicable; this is common for YAML-owned entities and cross-generation compatibility seams.

Indexes and uniqueness:

- No secondary index is declared beyond any rowid/primary-key storage.

## Who calls it

### Repository access surface

None found by exact static reference scan.

### Direct SQL readers

- `src/learnloop/db/migrate.py`

### Direct SQL writers

- `src/learnloop/db/migrate.py`

### Upstream callers of the repository access surface

None found by exact static reference scan.

> [!note] Static-reference boundary
> These lists are evidence from exact table-name SQL and repository-method calls. Dynamic dispatch and higher-level tests may exercise the table without spelling its name.

## Tests that define behavior

- `tests/test_doctor.py`
- `tests/test_init.py`
- `tests/test_migrate_fresh.py`
- `tests/test_migration_coordinator.py`
- `tests/test_persistence_open.py`

Always include `tests/test_migrations.py` and `tests/test_table_roles.py` when changing its schema or role. DERIVED-table changes also require `tests/test_rebuild_orchestrator.py` and `tests/test_shadow_rebuild.py`.

## Extension and modification guidance

1. Put schema evolution in a new numbered file under `migrations/`; never edit the meaning of an already-applied migration for existing vaults.
2. Update `src/learnloop/db/table_roles.py` in the same change. A new table without a role fails the migration-head registry test.
3. Keep SQL access at the repository/store boundary; put policy in the domain callers listed above.
4. Preserve append-only triggers and historical rows. Do not infer that an empty fixture table is safe to drop.

## Live schema DDL

> [!tip] Why keep the DDL here?
> It captures CHECK constraints and defaults that a column summary can hide. The migration files remain authoritative.

```sql
CREATE TABLE schema_migrations (
  version INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  applied_at TEXT NOT NULL
);
```
