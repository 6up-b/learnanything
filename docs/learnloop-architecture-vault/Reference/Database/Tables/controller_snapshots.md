# `controller_snapshots`

> [!info] Active
> The table participates in a current persistence, audit, projection, or workflow contract.

## Why it exists

Gives controller snapshot a stable database identity so queue and controller decisions can resume safely and explain why an activity was selected. It preserves the decision trail and is never cleared by derived-state rebuilds. Rows bind `session_id`, `snapshot_hash`, `param_manifest_hash`, making the operational relationship explicit. ^table-purpose

It belongs to the **scheduling** navigation family. The family context lives in [[Database Catalog#Scheduling]]. Its persistence behavior follows [[Table Roles#Receipt]].

## Persistence and lifecycle contract

- **Role:** `receipt` — Historical audit/decision receipt. It is preserved and never rebuilt.
- **Functionality status:** `active`.
- **Introduced by:** `migrations/096_controller_snapshots.sql`.
- **Schema touched by:** `096_controller_snapshots.sql`.
- **Rebuild owner:** none; this table is preserved by the rebuild umbrella.

For the distinction between SQLite state and human-authored vault files, see [[State and Persistence]]. For whole-vault creation and opening behavior, see [[Vault Lifecycle]]. ^table-lifecycle

## Columns

| Column | SQLite type | Required | Default | Key | Operational reading |
|---|---|---:|---|---|---|
| `id` | `TEXT` | no | — | PRIMARY KEY | Stored value |
| `snapshot_hash` | `TEXT` | yes | — | — | Stored value |
| `session_id` | `TEXT` | no | — | — | Application-validated soft reference |
| `body_json` | `TEXT` | yes | — | — | JSON-encoded structured payload |
| `param_manifest_hash` | `TEXT` | no | — | — | Stored value |
| `projection_versions_json` | `TEXT` | yes | `'{}'` | — | JSON-encoded structured payload |
| `created_at` | `TEXT` | yes | — | — | Timestamp (ISO-8601 UTC text) |

## Relationships and access paths

No SQLite foreign key is declared. Identifier-looking columns are application-validated soft references where applicable; this is common for YAML-owned entities and cross-generation compatibility seams.

Indexes and uniqueness:

- `idx_controller_snapshots_session` on `session_id`, `created_at`.
- `sqlite_autoindex_controller_snapshots_2` on `snapshot_hash` (unique).
- `sqlite_autoindex_controller_snapshots_1` on `id` (unique).

## Who calls it

### Repository access surface

None found by exact static reference scan.

### Direct SQL readers

- `src/learnloop/scheduling/controller_store.py`

### Direct SQL writers

- `src/learnloop/scheduling/controller_store.py`

### Upstream callers of the repository access surface

None found by exact static reference scan.

> [!note] Static-reference boundary
> These lists are evidence from exact table-name SQL and repository-method calls. Dynamic dispatch and higher-level tests may exercise the table without spelling its name.

## Tests that define behavior

- `tests/test_migrations.py`
- `tests/test_prequential.py`

Always include `tests/test_migrations.py` and `tests/test_table_roles.py` when changing its schema or role. DERIVED-table changes also require `tests/test_rebuild_orchestrator.py` and `tests/test_shadow_rebuild.py`.

## Extension and modification guidance

1. Put schema evolution in a new numbered file under `migrations/`; never edit the meaning of an already-applied migration for existing vaults.
2. Update `src/learnloop/db/table_roles.py` in the same change. A new table without a role fails the migration-head registry test.
3. Keep SQL access at the repository/store boundary; put policy in the domain callers listed above.
4. Preserve append-only triggers and historical rows. Do not infer that an empty fixture table is safe to drop.

## Live schema DDL

> [!tip] Why keep the DDL here?
> It captures CHECK constraints and defaults that a column summary can hide. The migration files remain authoritative.

```sql
CREATE TABLE controller_snapshots (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  snapshot_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
  session_id TEXT,
  -- The canonical snapshot body (state projections, feasible-input material,
  -- registered-parameter + projection versions). Never any cold-answer material.
  body_json TEXT NOT NULL,
  param_manifest_hash TEXT,
  projection_versions_json TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',
  created_at TEXT NOT NULL,
  UNIQUE(snapshot_hash)
);
```
