# `learnloop_sidecar.__main__`

> [!info] Generated source reference
> Facts in this note are generated from the Python AST, repository tests, and Git. Purpose and change guidance are conservative inferences from those facts. Regenerate with `.venv/bin/python docs/learnloop-architecture-vault/_scripts/module_generate.py`; do not hand-edit generated sections.

## Why this module exists

This module keeps main behavior inside its owning package, [[Reference/Modules/learnloop_sidecar/_package|learnloop_sidecar]]. Its public surface centers on `main`.

The authoritative system-level explanation remains in [[Architecture Overview]]; this note records where this source module participates rather than restating those concepts.

## Public API

- `main() -> None` ([source](../../../../../src/learnloop_sidecar/__main__.py), line 11)

## Internal implementation anchors

No private top-level function or class definition is declared in this file.

## Who imports or calls it

> [!note] Static evidence boundary
> “Calls” below means a direct call through a statically imported name that the AST can resolve. Registry, entry-point, reflection, and string-based dispatch can add runtime consumers.

No live LearnLoop module directly imports this module in the static graph.

## Dependencies

### LearnLoop dependencies

- [[Reference/Modules/learnloop/config/__init__|learnloop.config]] — imports `load_dotenv`; calls `load_dotenv`
- [[Reference/Modules/learnloop_sidecar/logging|learnloop_sidecar.logging]] — imports `configure_logging`; calls `configure_logging`
- [[Reference/Modules/learnloop_sidecar/server|learnloop_sidecar.server]] — imports `serve`; calls `serve`

### Platform and third-party dependencies

- Standard library: `__future__`, `pathlib`, `sys`
- Third party: none imported directly

## Larger workflow participation

Use this module in context through:

- [[Initialize a Vault]]
- [[Start a Learning Cycle]]
- [[Import Canonical Sources]]
- [[Process Model Output]]
- [[Inspect Persistent State]]

No live LearnLoop module imports it directly; its current reach is tests, repository tooling, dynamic registration, or explicit manual invocation where documented above.

The workflow notes own end-to-end sequencing; this reference owns only the module-level source map, contracts, and change surface.

## Tests that define behavior

No direct or one-hop consumer test was found by static import analysis.

> [!caution] Test gap signal
> Treat this as a navigation signal, not proof that behavior is untested: dynamic and higher-level coverage is outside this static map. Add focused coverage when changing isolated behavior here.

## Modification guidance

- Change request/response adaptation or presentation here. Put reusable learning policy in its domain package, not in the adapter.
- Run the directly importing tests below, then the architecture/import-linter checks when imports or public ownership change.

### Regeneration and review checklist

1. Modify [src/learnloop_sidecar/__main__.py](../../../../../src/learnloop_sidecar/__main__.py) and its owning tests.
2. Regenerate [[Module Catalog]] so imports, symbols, source provenance, and test anchors remain current.
3. Run `.venv/bin/python docs/learnloop-architecture-vault/_scripts/module_validate.py`.
4. If ownership or workflow behavior changed, update the linked canonical concept or workflow note—not a duplicate explanation here.
